    <h1>Recurrent Diabetes</h1>

    <p>Hello, today I would like to talk about so called "Recurrent Diabetes". I have looked into this
        and I have found nothing such as "Recurrent Diabetes". People have said that they get high sugar
        when they're stressed out, it's most surely just the outcome of high blood pressure that comes
        to people when they're really stressed out, other than that, recurrent diabetes does not exist,
        and if you think otherwise than you're really gullible. Anyways, have a good day.

        Sincerely, Doctor Mario Freego.
